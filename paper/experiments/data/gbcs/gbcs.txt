DESCRITPTIVE ABSTRACT:
Description of the variables in the German Breast Cancer Study (GBCS) dataset shown
in Table 1.4 of reference text.

Description of the Study:
Cancer clinical trials are a rich source for examples of applications
of methods for the analysis of time to event.  Willi Sauerbrei and Patrick
Royston have graciously provided us with data obtained from the German Breast
Cancer Study Group, which they used to illustrate methods for building
prognostic models (Sauerbrei and Royston, 1999).  In the main study,
a total of 720 patients with primary node positive breast cancer were
recruited between July 1984, and December 1989, (see Schmoor, Olschweski
and Schumacher M. 1996 and Schumacher et al. (1994)).
